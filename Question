ðŸ§ª Practical Question: Matrix Operations in R

Task:

You are working with data involving test scores of students across three subjects. Each row in a matrix represents a student, and each column represents a subject: Math, Science, and English.

Step-by-step Instructions:

Create a 3x3 matrix named scores with the following data filled by row:

Math	Science	English
85	90	88
78	85	84
92	88	91

Perform the following tasks:

a. Print the matrix.
b. Extract the scores of the second student.
c. Extract all Science scores (i.e., the second column).
d. Calculate the total score for each student using apply().
e. Calculate the average score for each subject.

========

Step 1: Create the matrix (filled by row)
# Create the scores matrix
scores <- matrix(
  c(85, 90, 88,
    78, 85, 84,
    92, 88, 91),
  nrow = 3,
  byrow = TRUE
)

print(scores)


Output:

     [,1] [,2] [,3]
[1,]   85   90   88
[2,]   78   85   84
[3,]   92   88   91

Step 2a: Extract scores of the second student
scores[2, ]


Output:

[1] 78 85 84

Step 2b: Extract all Science scores (second column)
scores[, 2]


Output:

[1] 90 85 88

Step 2c: Total score for each student (row sums)
apply(scores, 1, sum)


Output:

[1] 263 247 271

Step 2d: Average score for each subject (column means)
apply(scores, 2, mean)


Output:

[1] 85.00 87.67 87.67
