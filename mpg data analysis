scatter plot (engine size vs highway mileage)
ðŸ‘‰ question: does bigger engine â†’ lower fuel efficiency?

ggplot(mpg, aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) +
  geom_point()


ðŸ”Ž interpretation:
x-axis = engine size (litres)
y-axis = highway mpg
points show each car model
youâ€™ll notice downward trend: bigger engines give lower mpg.
====================================================================
scatter with color by class
ðŸ‘‰ compare different vehicle classes:

ggplot(mpg, aes(x = displ, y = hwy, color = class)) +
  geom_point()

ðŸ”Ž now each point is colored by class (SUV, compact, etc.), making differences clear
======================================================================================
add a trend line
ggplot(mpg, aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.6) +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE)    
//lm = linear model without it line are curve 
//se=standard error which cause grey line in each linear line
=============================================================================================================
bar plot (count cars per class)
ggplot(mpg, aes(x = class)) +  //here we not mention y axis show it is consider as count of row by default
  geom_bar(fill = "skyblue")

ðŸ”Ž shows how many cars are in each class.

===================================================================
ggplot(mpg, aes(x = class, y = hwy, fill = class)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  theme(legend.position = "none")   

//theme is use to customized non datapart
//ðŸ”¹ legend.position
This controls where the legend appears on the plot.
Options:
"right" (default)
"left"
"top"
"bottom"
"none" â†’ removes the legend entirely.

shows geom_boxplot()
